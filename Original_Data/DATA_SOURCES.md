# Data Sources

Maine's 2016 "Integrated Report" is the ultimate source for all info
on Impaired waters.  That is the most recent finalized Maine Integrated Report. 
The Integrated Report documents are available on Maine DEP's website, at 
https://www.maine.gov/dep/water/monitoring/305b/index.html .  Copies are
included here for reference.

## Geospatial Data
Curtis C. Bohlen Received an E-mail from Becky Schaffner, at Maine DEP on 
November 19th, 2020, containing a layer package file, 
`ADB_2016_Integrated_REport.lpk`.  A layer package contains both data
and symbology. The data can be extracted, edited, symbolized, etc.

This file includes the geospatial data for impaired stream and river
reaches statewide.
